The study involved 30 volunteers (ages 19-48) performing six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) while wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on their waist. Data was captured using the phoneâ€™s accelerometer and gyroscope at 50Hz. The dataset was split into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets.

Sensor signals were pre-processed with noise filters and segmented into sliding windows of 2.56 seconds (128 readings/window) with a 50% overlap. Body and gravitational accelerations were separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter (0.3 Hz cutoff). Each window generated a feature vector with 561 time and frequency domain variables.
